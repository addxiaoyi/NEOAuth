# DirectAuth

![Build Status](https://github.com/marc-perez-dev/DirectAuth/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

DirectAuth is a **server-side** authentication mod for Minecraft NeoForge 1.21.1. It provides a secure login system for offline-mode servers, with optional auto-login for players who own a legitimate Minecraft account.

It is strictly server-side: clients do **not** need to install this mod to join. Players can connect with any vanilla client.

All database operations run asynchronously, so the main server thread never freezes during logins.

## Key Features

* **Server-Side Only**: Install it on your server and players join with any vanilla client. Nothing to install client-side.
* **Zero-Configuration Database**: Uses an embedded SQLite database. No MySQL or external database server required.
* **No Lag**: All database I/O is performed asynchronously on a separate thread pool.
* **Strong Security**: Passwords are hashed with PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256 using a unique salt per user.
* **Online Auto-Login**: Players with a legitimate Mojang/Microsoft account can use `/online` to verify their account and skip typing passwords in future sessions.
* **Session Grace Period**: If a player disconnects and reconnects within the configured grace period, they stay authenticated without logging in again.
* **Anti-Bot Protection**: Configurable registration delay and a maximum number of accounts per IP address.
* **Strict Restrictions**: Unauthenticated players cannot move, chat, interact with blocks/entities, drop or pick up items, attack, gain XP, or regenerate health.
* **Smart Data Migration**: When a player switches from offline to online mode their UUID changes, so the mod automatically migrates their data to the new UUID (see below).
* **Localization**: Ships with English (`en`) and Spanish (`es`); fully customizable message strings.

## Commands

### Player commands

| Command | Usage | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **/register** | `/register <password>` | Creates a new account. Required on first connection. |
| **/login** | `/login <password>` | Authenticates your session. |
| **/logout** | `/logout` | Logs you out (disconnects you from the server). |
| **/changepassword** | `/changepassword <oldPassword> <newPassword>` | Changes your password. Requires being logged in. |
| **/unregister** | `/unregister <password>` | Permanently deletes your own account (confirms with your password). |
| **/online** | `/online <password>` | Verifies your account against Mojang's servers to enable auto-login. **Migrates your data to a new UUID** — see the warning below. |
| **/directauth confirm** | `/directauth confirm` | Confirms a pending action when the mod requests it. |

### Admin commands (require OP level 4)

| Command | Usage | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **/directauth online** | `/directauth online <user> <true\|false>` | Manually toggles a player's online-mode status. |
| **/directauth resetpass** | `/directauth resetpass <user> <newPassword>` | Resets a player's password. |
| **/directauth unregister** | `/directauth unregister <user>` | Force-deletes a player's account (and kicks them if online). |
| **/directauth reload** | `/directauth reload` | Reloads the config and language files from disk at runtime — no server restart needed. |
| **/directauth resetlang** | `/directauth resetlang` | Deletes the language files so they regenerate from the mod's built-in defaults (discards manual edits). |

## ⚠️ Important: Online Mode Migration

When a player runs `/online`, their UUID changes from the offline UUID to their real Mojang UUID, and DirectAuth migrates their data to the new UUID.

**By default** the mod already migrates vanilla data (inventory, ender chest, advancements, statistics) **and** a few common mods (graves/deaths, FTB Quests, SkinRestorer).

If your server uses **other** mods that store per-player data (e.g. Curios, Astral Sorcery, FTB Teams), the server administrator must add those folder names to the migration config **before** players run `/online`. Otherwise that mod-specific progress may be lost.

> **Always back up your world before migrating on a heavily modded server.**

## Installation

1. Download the `.jar` file.
2. Place it in the `mods` folder of your NeoForge 1.21.1 server.
3. Restart the server.

On first launch the following files are generated:

* Config: `world/serverconfig/DirectAuth-config.json`
* Language files: `world/serverconfig/DirectAuth-lang-en.json` and `DirectAuth-lang-es.json`
* Database: `world/serverconfig/directauth.db`

## Configuration

Edit `world/serverconfig/DirectAuth-config.json` to customize:

* **Language**: `language` (`"en"` or `"es"`).
* **Security**: `minPasswordLength`, `maxPasswordLength`, `maxLoginAttempts`, `loginCooldownMs`, `loginTimeout` (seconds before a non-authenticated player is kicked).
* **Sessions**: `sessionGracePeriod` (seconds a session survives after disconnect) and `sessionCleanupInterval` (minutes between cleanups of expired sessions).
* **Anti-Bot**: `registrationDelay` (seconds to wait before a fresh player can register) and `maxAccountsPerIP`.
* **Data Migration**: `migrationMap` — a map of *folder name → migration mode*. To support an extra mod, add its data folder there. Available modes:
    * `RENAME` — rename a single file that is named after the UUID (most vanilla data, SkinRestorer).
    * `DIRECTORY` — move/rename a whole folder named after the UUID (e.g. graves).
    * `TEXT_REPLACE` — rename the file **and** replace UUID strings inside its contents (e.g. FTB Quests).

  Example:

  ```json
  "migrationMap": {
    "playerdata": "RENAME",
    "stats": "RENAME",
    "advancements": "RENAME",
    "deaths": "DIRECTORY",
    "ftbquests": "TEXT_REPLACE",
    "skinrestorer": "RENAME"
  }
  ```

Message strings can be edited in the `DirectAuth-lang-*.json` files.

## Troubleshooting (FAQ)

**Q: I keep getting teleported back when I move / I can't eat or regenerate health.**
A: You aren't authenticated yet. Use `/register <password>` (first time) or `/login <password>`.

**Q: I lost my items from [some mod] after using `/online`.**
A: The server administrator likely hadn't added that mod's data folder to `migrationMap`. Contact your admin.

## Technical Details

* **Hashing**: PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256 with a unique salt per user.
* **Storage**: SQLite at `world/serverconfig/directauth.db` — no external database server. A legacy `DirectAuth_users.json` is migrated automatically on first run if present.
* **Session Management**: Sessions are validated against the internal database (and Mojang's session servers for online users).
* **Protection**: The login listener is injected at high priority to prevent unauthorized packet processing.

## Compatibility

* **Loader**: NeoForge 1.21.1
* **Side**: Server-side only — works with any vanilla client and can be included in any modpack.
* **Supported**: Dedicated servers and local LAN worlds.
* **Not supported**: BungeeCord/Velocity networks that need player data synchronized across multiple server instances (e.g. Lobby → Survival transfers), since data is stored in the local world directory.
